# scratch
Browser extension for plain text pasting
Installation:
Go to https://github.com/MooseGoggles/scratch
Download the files as a zip by clicking “Clone or Download”  then "Download ZIP". 
Unzip them anywhere on your hard drive, like My Documents\Extensions\Scratch or something like that.
Go to your browser’s Extensions page (Chrome: menu > More Tools > Extensions). 
Click the "Developer Mode" switch on if it’s off. 
Click “LOAD UNPACKED” and select the folder (folder, not file(s)) where you unzipped the files and hit OK. 
That’s it, you should now see a yellow post-it in your browser toolbar  :)
